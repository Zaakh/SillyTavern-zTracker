# zTracker specs index

These are “living” per-change specs. Each spec tracks its current status and open questions that must be clarified **before** implementation.

## Specs
- [01-rename-to-ztracker.md](01-rename-to-ztracker.md)
- [02-testing-strategy.md](02-testing-strategy.md)
- [02-B-entrypoint-wiring-tests.md](02-B-entrypoint-wiring-tests.md)
- [03-versioning-semver.md](03-versioning-semver.md)
- [04-changelog.md](04-changelog.md)
- [05-tracker-context-injection.md](05-tracker-context-injection.md)
- [06-multi-connection-profiles.md](06-multi-connection-profiles.md)
- [07-world-info-policy.md](07-world-info-policy.md)
- [08-sequential-part-generation.md](08-sequential-part-generation.md)

## Status workflow
- **Open**: not implemented yet; questions unresolved.
- **In Progress**: implementation ongoing.
- **Completed**: implemented + verified; includes notes on how it was validated.

When a spec is completed, add a short “Verification” section (what was tested, how to reproduce).
